LAI Games Unity3D Code Test - 1 hour

Open the test project in Unity. The test project is built with Unity 2018.2.5.
In the Assets folder there is a file called "Data.json". 
In the scene there is one cube mesh called 'Cube' and two empty GameObjects called 'PositionA' and 'PositionB'.

The goal of the project is to programmatically load the values in the Data.json file, then use those values to animate 'Cube' from 'PositionA' to 'PositionB'.

You must:

Programmatically load the values from the Data.json file.
Implement a script that spawns a 'Cube' each time the player presses Enter. 
When your 'Cube' spawns it should wait for 'AnimationDelay' seconds before starting to animate.
After the delay, your 'Cube' should take 'AnimationDuration' seconds to animate from the position of 'PositionA' to the position of 'PositionB'. It should animate programmatically.
The cube should be destroyed or disappear after 'CubeLifetime' seconds.
Create a UI that displays the number of cubes that have been spawned.
Write a shader that changes the appearance of the cube based on its position.
If you have spare time after completing the above you can add or improve features or effects.
